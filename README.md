### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Recommender System Algorithm Impementation and Evaluation
+ Team Number: Group 3 
+ Team Members: Alek Anichowski, Jerome Kafrouni, Pak Kin Lai, Chunzi Wang
+ Project summary: In this project we implemented model-based algorithm (EM Clustering) and memory-based algorithms (similarity weights used include Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Cosine Vector, Entropy, Mean Squared Difference, Significance and Variance Weighting) to built a collaborative filtering recommender system. We built these algorithms from scratch and then evaluated their performance on two datasets: implicit voting Microsoft Web Data and explicit voting EachMovie data.
+ Prediction Results:

#### Contribution statement

+ Alek Anichowski - Implemented significance and variance weighting
+ Jerome Kafrouni - Implemented the EM algorithm, Cross-validation to choose number of clusters, and predictions based on the parameters outputted by EM.
+ Pak Kin Lai - Calculated and evaluated Entropy and Vector similarity weights. Provided the outline for the main rmd file. Created the evaluation functions for movie and MS.
+ Chunzi Wang - Calculated and evaluated Pearson, Spearman, Mean Squared Difference, and SimRank similarity weights. Combined all memory-based work into a main.rmd file. Wrote this markdown and initiated the creation of presentation slides.

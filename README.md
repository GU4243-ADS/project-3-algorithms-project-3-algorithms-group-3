### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Recommender System Algorithm Impementation and Evaluation
+ Team Number: Group 3 
+ Team Members: Alek Anichowski, Jerome Kafrouni, Pak Kin Lai, Chunzi Wang
+ Project summary: In this project we implemented model-based algorithm (EM Clustering) and memory-based algorithms (similarity weights used include Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Cosine Vector, Entropy, Mean Squared Difference, Significance and Variance Weighting) to built a collaborative filtering recommender system. We built these algorithms from scratch and then evaluated their performance on two datasets: implicit voting Microsoft Web Data and explicit voting EachMovie data.
+ Prediction Results:
